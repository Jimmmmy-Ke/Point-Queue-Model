# Point-Queue-Model
This is a point queue model (PQM), which is very simple but works well.

The PQM is used to emulate a high occupancy toll (HOT) lane pricing scenario.
A similar scenario can be seen in Lou and Yin xxx

In present codes, a dynamic price strategy proposed is reproduced, which is proposed collaboratively by my senior 
colleage Xuting Wang, Prof. Wenlong Jin and Prof. Yafeng Yin. The related paper is very interesting and submitted 
to IEEE T-ITS.

Dr. Xuting Wang is going to be a post-doc at PSU, good luck for her.
